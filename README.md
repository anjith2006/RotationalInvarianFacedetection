# RotationalInvarianFacedetection

RotationalInvarianFacedetection: An extension of OpenCV face detector for video. 

## Requirements

OpenCV compiled with python, numpy, dlib (for example 2)

## Running 

1. Face detection: Just clone the repo and run 'python main.py' for simple face detection

2. Face detection and landmark detection : Run 'python main_dlib_ri.py' for face landmark as well (this one requires dlib to be installed)
